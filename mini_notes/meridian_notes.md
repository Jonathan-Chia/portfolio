Questions for Garth:

* How do we incorporate reach and frequency into DD 2.0? 

"Paid search campaigns that target brand-specific queries are very different from those that target more generic product related queries. It is best to include these campaigns as separate media channels in the model."

* Should I keep these separate in my model?
